libxmp version 3.9.0

This is an experimental release of libxmp. The API can be modified until
the 4.0 stable release.

This is licensed under the GPL. The stable library will be licensed under
the LGPLIf we can obtain permission from authors of third-party code such as
the IT sample decompressor and the YM2149 emulator.

Better documentation will be included in the stable relase. Until then,
check the xmp.h header file and the xmp player front-end. A simple example
on how to use this library:


xmp_context ctx;		/* context handle */
struct xmp_module_info info;	/* struct to hold module info */

ctx = xmp_create_context();

xmp_load_module(ctx, filename);		/* load the module file */

xmp_player_start(ctx, 0, 44100, 0);	/* play the module file */
while (xmp_player_frame(ctx) == 0) {
	xmp_player_get_info(&info);
	/* audio buffer in info.buffer and info.buffer_size */
}
xmp_player_end(ctx);			/* end the module player */

xmp_release_module(ctx);		/* unload module */
xmp_free_context(ctx);
