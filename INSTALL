Requirements
------------

- This package needs the GNU make. In BSD or SysV you may need to use
  gmake instead of make.


Building libxmp
---------------

In most systems just execute:

$ ./configure
$ make

Use ./configure --disable-static or --disable-shared if you don't want
to build static or shared libraries. To check if the library was correctly
built, run:

$ make check


Installation
------------

To install the library and development components, just run:

# make install

as the superuser. This will install the shared and static libraries,
header file and pkg-config file into directories under /usr/local or a
different location selected with the --prefix option in configure.
